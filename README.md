# Anti-stress-ball

In this project, we are trying to measure the stress level of the user with the help of a force sensor attached on the surface of an anti-stress ball, which is connected to an Arduino Uno R3. The force applied on the ball (and the sensor) is considered to be proportional to the magnitude of the user's stress level. The stress level of the user and some helpful suggestions to relieve the stress can be seen on a webpage.
